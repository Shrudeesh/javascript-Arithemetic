             <p id="paragraph">SCIENTISTS HAVE LEARNED TO SUPPLEMENT THE SENSE OF SIGHT IN NUMEROUS WAYS. In front of the tiny pupil of
                 the eye they put, on Mount Palomar, a great monocle 200 inches in diameter, and with it see 2000 times
                 farther into the depths of space. Or they look through a small pair of lenses arranged as a microscope
                 into a drop of water or blood, and magnify by as much as 2000 diameters the living creatures there,
                 many of which are among mans most dangerous enemies. </p>
